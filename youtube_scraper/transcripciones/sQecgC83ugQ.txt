What happened to altcoins? It's a great question. They collapsed and they put in new lows. Do you see that? They put in new lows even though ETH barely pulled back on its Bitcoin pair. This is ETH Dominance. Let's go back to ETH Bitcoin so you don't call me out on it in the comments. Um, and you can call me out uh if you look at at at ETH Bitcoin, right? This tiny little pullback sent alts to new lows. So, I know it seemed like a crazy proposition when I first suggested that back in earlier this year that like ETH Bitcoin could put in a higher low and all Bitcoin pairs could put in lower lows. Seemed crazy and people were like, there's no way. That's exactly what happened,
