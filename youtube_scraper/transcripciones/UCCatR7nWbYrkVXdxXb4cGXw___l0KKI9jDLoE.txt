XRP update for July 17th of 2025. In my last update, we highlighted that the $3 region was likely to cause a little bit of a cool down before continuing to the upside. I was waiting over the weekend to see how things shook up. We obviously got a breakout out of Bitcoin. All coins are moving now, and this is where XRP is heading next most likely. So, here's the XRP chart. We've been ranging sideways pretty much ever since the end of last year, right into December after we had a 500 plus% rally. We had a pullback towards this 179 which is where the last place where I loaded up after this last recent pullback. And since then we have a reclaim of the key region that we were looking to which was that that $241 region which was crucial to get above and as we can see the second that we did it has been off to the races ever since. To keep this relatively short and sweet, here is the next major area that is likely for XRP to reach up to, as well as maybe see a little bit of a next cool down, potentially a little pullback from that area before continuing higher yet again. Next major target for me is going to be right here sitting at the 1:1 at about $4.50. I like the $4.50 mark because it fronts the $5 target that many will be looking to. Not to say that we can't see $5 in the near future here, but I could see us running up to this region. This is a major Fibonacci extension point. uh getting a little cool down at that region and then continuing higher after that in the coming weeks as we go on into August and September. Let me know what your thoughts are on XRP down in the comments. Are we going to see this push up to the upside or is this going to be yet again another fake out of the all-time high and then a crash back
